            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I currently live in NYC and work @ Airbnb. Prior to that I spent 6 years living in <strong><em>San Francisco</em></strong>, 5 of which was spent as a consultant. Outside of work, I enjoy food, fitness, music, and learning.</p>
            <p>I am an alumnus of Duke University, where I triple majored in Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, and Economics.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m not the most open person, but I think great things can happen when we connect with our fellow people. Throughout this site, I hope I can share a piece of who I am, what I value, and where I want to go. Shoot me a message if anything resonates with you or if you want to have a deeper chat. ðŸ™‚</p>
