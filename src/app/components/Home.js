                        <p>Thanks for visiting my site. I initially created this site to learn <strong>web development</strong>, but in the process I realized it could be used for much more.</p>
                        <h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
                        <p>I currently live in NYC and work @ Airbnb. Prior to that I spent 6 years living in <strong><em>San Francisco</em></strong>, 5 of which was spent as a consultant. Outside of work, I enjoy food, fitness, music, and learning.</p>
                        <p>I am an alumnus of Duke University, where I triple majored in Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, and Economics.</p>
                        <p>I‚Äôm not the most open person, but I think great things can happen when we connect with our fellow people. Throughout this site, I hope I can share a piece of who I am, what I value, and where I want to go. Shoot me a message if anything resonates with you or if you want to have a deeper chat. üôÇ</p>
